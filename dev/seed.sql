  <p>Time travel themes in science fiction and the media can generally be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-many-worlds interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When they explained timelines in the show, I got the idea of the timelines being alternate, but then we got all of this "Alpha/Beta timeline", and that goes more with the immutable timelines, with some alternate-difficult-to-reach timelines.</p>

<p>And at the end, Okabe couldn''t change the beta timeline, except if he cheated himself (which would make the timeline mutable)...</p>

<p>So, did the scriptwriters just cherry-picked things as they felt it could add more drama? (For example, I was telling myself all the time: if Kurisu dies in timeline beta, and Mayuri dies in timeline alpha... wouldn''t the solution be going to timeline Gamma?!) </p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>

The most obvious examples of this are references to Gundam or Sgt. Frog (both of which are notably Sunrise shows). Presumably this is done to avoid KyoAni getting sued. This also explains why references to Haruhi and Full Metal Panic weren''t censored (as far as I remember). Interestingly these instances of censorship probably could have been removed in the English release since it was licensed by Bandai, but I don''t know if they actually were, so this question might only apply to the Japanese version.</p>

<p>However, there are still a few cases of references which weren''t censored despite no obvious connection between the Lucky Star team and the source. The one that immediately comes to mind is To Heart, which is referenced several times. To Heart is associated with VN studio Leaf as well as animation studios Oriental Light and Magic and AIC, neither of which have anything to do with Lucky Star (KyoAni and Kadokawa). I can''t find any connections between them, but of course that could be oversight on my part, and I didn''t check all of the individual staff members.</p>

<p>If you pay attention, you can also spot where the characters aren''t moving much in certain points in the video (like where Panty & Stocking are standing still under the "disco" lighting), so they can get away with only drawing the frame once even though the scene goes for much longer. </p>

<p>When "tweening" between keyframes (to produce moving animation like your soccer ball example), yes, those have to be hand-drawn -- or at least hand-checked, even if a computer is used to extrapolate between keyframes!

If it happens well in advance and the character is pretty important, they can probably work around it. Gotou Yuuko (seiyuu for Hiro from Hidamari Sketch), who was on hiatus for a while this year for health reasons but is back now in Hidamari Sketch x Honeycomb, is a good example of this. However, this is a pretty atypical situation, and the other shows she was in mostly got replacements.</p>

<p>In the end, unless the character is crucially important, it''s very likely that they''ll get a replacement, since it''s pretty much the only realistic option. If something like this happens for a popular character in the off-season, it can also affect the possibility of sequels (e.g. most shows with Aya Hirano leads probably aren''t in the sequel market). It usually doesn''t hurt the seiyuu''s career too much if it occurs for good reasons e.g. health, but some impact is inevitable.</p>

<p>Manga production happens at a much smaller scale compared to <a href="http://washiblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/anime-production-detailed-guide-to-how-anime-is-made-and-the-talent-behind-it/" rel="nofollow">anime production</a>.</p>

<p>For anime production, on top of publisher front costs, you have to get your staff, sponsors, script, character/set designers, broadcasting rights, and advertising ready before the production even starts. </p>

<p>Typically only half the budget allocated to an anime is used by the studio in charge. </p>

<p>Manga production can vary greatly. Some authors are interested in creative input from their assistants, while others only ask them to assist. Some artists like do to as much of the work themselves as possible, others have their assistants fill in most of the page while the artist only draws the "name" (a kind of storyboard for manga) and main characters.</p>

<p>Anime are usually created and broadcast at a loss while profits are made from DVD/Blu-ray and merchandising sales. Most mangas are produced at a loss, their viability access by their rank in their parent magazine''s reader survey polls and takubon (volume) sales. </p>

<p>Generally, it takes around <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/makaronisan/20060719/1153219520" rel="nofollow">8,000,000 to 10,000,000 yen</a> to make a "30 minute" episode anime, while it takes only about 2,000,000 yen to produce a weekly serialization, because it typically takes 2 months for a tankoubon can be compiled, at a 100-page monthly production rate. </p>

<p>On top of that you have to factor in rent for the studio, and payroll (pay + pensions) for that staff which typically is composed of 1 chief-assistant + 2 or 3 assistants + 1 background artist, typically a group of 4 to 5 people. Different authors/artist get different rates depending on the publisher and the experience/fame of the author/artist. </p>

<p>Most animators are <a href="http://motoz5.cocolog-nifty.com/animator/2006/12/post_41df.html" rel="nofollow">contract employees to a production studio</a>. Therefore they do not get benefits, pensions, or vacations. Because many productions employ so many animators for their tween animations it can be hard to keeps track of who''s who and doing what.</p>

<p>A well managed small anime production can sometimes be more efficient than a large high budget manga serialization, but the opposite can be true as well. It usually comes down to who is an change and how the work trickles down.</p>

<p>Cartoons are <em>mainly</em> produced for <em>kids</em>, with topics about friendship, fun, exploration and similar things.</p>

<p>Anime / manga and related media <em>mainly</em> are produced for targets of <em>all ages</em> (except for Hentai and Ecchi series, of course). They can of course contain the "kids content", but there are much more serious ones out there, e.g. ones about love, death, conflicts, and wars. They''re simply much deeper. The drawing and character art of cartoons is often vastly deformed / otherworldly to emphasize the disconnect from reality and the fun part of it.</p>

<p>Another difference is the way characters evolve. In most comics I''ve read, you have episodic experiences which are, at most, loosely connected, and so characters don''t really evolve / grow up. I''m sure there are counter-examples out there, but I think we can agree that the characters are not the focus.</p>

<p>For most anime and related media, the characters are <em>much</em> deeper. Of course you also have the occasional counter-example here, but the characters get a much bigger focus.</p>

<p>You can think of anime / manga / visual novels / light novels as (Western) books / series / movies with regards to the content, except they''re drawn (or have illustrative content) instead of being filmed / purely in written form.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that there are examples of anime that look and feel just like Western cartoons (Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, for the "look" aspect, at least) and the other way around (Avatar - The Last Airbender, Korra).</p>

<p><strong>Visual characteristics</strong><br>
Anime: Distinct facial expressions. Wide variation in physical characteristics. 
Physical features of characters are, on the whole, closer to reality than cartoons.<br>
Cartoon: Characters usually have features that are not relative to the rest of the body and therefore further from reality than anime.</p>

<p><strong>Topics/Themes</strong><br>
Anime: concentrates mostly on life issues or things tied closer to human emotion.<br>
Cartoons: are generally made to make people laugh and so is more comical.</p>

<p><strong>Definition and Term:</strong><br>
Anime: English dictionaries define the word as ‘Japanese style of motion picture animation’.<br>
Cartoon: was used as a model or study for a painting but is now associated with caricatures for humor and satire.</p>

<p>First of all, the <strong>audience</strong>. The main <em>objective</em> difference is that Anime are not cartoons for kids, usually. </p>

<p>Some Anime get censored when dubbed in foreign countries and they are rendered as quite childish (and this is sometimes really annoying), while the original holds some adult references, scenes containing violence and so on. While this is not true for all Anime, as some are really aimed to children, some of them need a mature audience. </p>

<p>Also, the <strong>characters</strong> are treated quite differently. There is more growth in Anime characters as it develops for a whole series. For example, <em>Zabuza</em> in Naruto ends up being quite a likeable character because you go beyond him simply being an antagonist. </p>

<p>Both Anime and cartoons treat <strong>themes</strong> like <em>life, death, religion, love, betrayal, ethics, etc</em>. But cartoons really treat such matters quite differently.

<p>Many English-language dictionaries <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anime">define</a> anime as "a Japanese style of motion-picture animation" or as "a style of animation developed in Japan."</p>

<p>However, in Japan, the term "anime" does not specify an animation''s nation of origin or style. Instead, it serves as a blanket term to refer to all forms of animation from around the world (both foreign and domestic). The word "anime" is loan word referring to "animation" or "cartoons," adapted from the English word "animation."  </p>

<p>Taking this from another perspective, in Japan, Disney movies are referred to as "Disney Anime", This refers to a certain style, not the genre as a whole.</p>

<p>The Japanese Wikipedia on "anime" <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1#anime">specifically notes</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>アニメーションをアニメと略せる言語は日本語に限られるため、日本国外で「anime」という場合は日本製の表現様式のアニメに対して用いられる。日本国内では、製作国や作風に関わりなくアニメが使用される。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While in Japanese, "animation" was abbreviated to "anime," Outside of Japan, the word has been used only to refer to media considered "Japanese animation." However in Japan, the country of origin and literary style (of the media) are not taken into account when applying "anime" to it.</p>

<p>Western cartoons and anime can both vary in drawing styles, based on the staff, budget, and character/set designs. Anime series are typically more detailed than your average western show as there is more of an abundance of technically skilled artists overseas than there are available in the West.</p>

<p>Both can reach different age regardless of their initial target audience (<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, <em>My Little Pony</em>, and <em>Adventure Time</em> are notable examples). </p>

<p>Typically western cartoons are more lighthearted when compared to Japanese anime. However, both can deal with more mature themes, in both a serious (like <em>Cyber 6</em>, <em>Mighty Max</em>, and <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>) and humorous light (like <em>Futurama</em>, <em>South Park</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, and <em>Family Guy</em>). There are western cartoons for mature adults just like there are 18+ anime in Japan.</p>

<p>If you ask the average person in your country and one in Japan, both will consider them to be childish. The difference between anime and cartoons is very subjective. It typically comes down to what you like and how you like it. </p>

The symbolic meaning is in the cycle of energy and life, where Equivalent Exchange ensures that objects are never created nor destroyed, but changed into different forms. My interpretation is that this embodiment of a principle of Alchemy helps the transmutation take place, but it is unnecessary if the alchemist has been to The Gate, thus embodying the principle of Alchemy by himself.</p>

<p>As for function, the transmutation circle harnesses the energy from the earth or substrate that the circle is drawn on (compare the energy sources of Amestris [SPOILER] and <a href="http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Alkahestry">Xing</a>). the geometric symbols (triangles, squares and other polygons) represent various elements (water/earth/fire/air), and other symbol-like runes which direct and manipulate the energies in more specific ways. So in the functional aspect, the diagrams and symbols in the transmutation circle serve as an "energy manipulation chamber" to harness for specific alchemical uses.</p>

	 (133,2,NULL,122,19,NULL,'<p>Warning, there are spoilers in this answer if you haven''t watched SAO completely yet.</p>

<p>For the SAO arc, outside of towns, you''re constantly "flagged" for PvP. From the beginnings, when you''re getting explained how the players are divided:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inside the city, or the places mostly referred to as «Safe Areas», there was protection implemented by the system and players couldn''t hurt each other. But it wasn''t like that outside. The stragglers made teams with other stragglers and ambushed other players —which was in many ways much more profitable than hunting monsters— out on the fields or the labyrinth areas. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Players that commit crimes are marked orange (i.e., their cursor turns orange). From when Kirito and Asuna encounter the troop from The Army in the forest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More importantly, whenever a player committed a crime, their cursor would turn orange and wouldn''t turn back to green for a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that attacking an orange player doesn''t change your cursor to orange. From when Asuna steps in to stop Kuradeel from killing Kirito:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kuradeel bounced back up as if he had springs and attempted to form an excuse with his nervous voice. But before he could finish, Asuna''s right hand flashed and the tip of her sword tore Kuradeel''s mouth. She didn''t become a criminal since her opponent already had an orange cursor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inside of towns, you have the town protection in place, which doesn''t allow open PvP, so many new players originally stayed in town to be safe. You can attack other people in towns, but it won''t do anything except for some special shiny effects and knockback.</p>

<p>If players engage in duels, there are several options:</p>

<ul>
<li>First Strike Mode - from the duel against Kuradeel:


<blockquote>
  <p>I nodded in reply, then pressed Yes and chose the «First Strike Mode» from the options. This was a duel that could be won either by landing the first clean hit or by reducing the opponent''s HP to half.</li>
  <li><p>Complete Decisive Mode - from the Inner Area PK incident:</p></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But unfortunately, there were still some loopholes around this rule. One of them is when the player''s sleeping. There are times when players, with their energy exhausted through long durations of battle, are basically unconscious when they go into a deep sleep, and unable to wake up even with some stimulations. With that opportunity, one could raise a request to duel in «Complete Decisive Mode» and moved the sleeping opponent''s finger to press on the OK button. All that was left was to literally make the opponent sleep like the dead.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>The other options are not explained or mentioned as far as I can see.</p>

<p>For the ALO arc, there''s PvP against other fairy races in your native race''s (controlled) towns. From when Lyfa/Suguha shows Kirito around meeting Sigurd:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Somehow, a circle of onlookers had already surrounded them, drawn by the signs of trouble. If this was a formal duel, or if he were an actual Spriggan spy, then fine. But it would be dishonorable if Sigurd instigated a fight with a tourist like Kirito, who can''t even fight back in this area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in that same quote, it''s mentioned that a "formal duel" is possible, but that''s not further explained. Outside of towns, you can fight without restrictions. This can be seen by people just fighting about everywhere. Note that if a race''s lord is killed by another race, the other race will gain control over that lord''s territory. From when Lyfa explains why the Salamander want to stop the Sylphid-Cait Sith alliance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Also, if they kill the Lord, they will get some amazing bonuses. They will unconditionally receive 30% of the lord''s funds stored in the mansion, and for ten days, the territory that the lord rules over would become occupied, then they are free to set taxes and take that money. That is a tremendous amount of money. The reason why Salamander became the largest force in the game was because in the past, they had set a trap for Sylph''s first Lord and killed him. Normally lords don''t venture into neutral territory. In the history of ALO, only one lord has ever been killed."</p>

  <p>The fact that the grail wasn''t all-powerful and yet still caused so much destruction is why Kotomine sets in motion the events of the 5th grail war.

	 (135,2,NULL,117,26,NULL,'<p>The transmutation circles contain the formulae and/or specific incantation needed to carry out a function.  There is always some part of the human mind that is involved in a transmutation (otherwise, Mustang''s gloves would only be able to mess with the air in a very select pattern), but in general more complicated transmutations will require a more robust "hard formula".  The "soft formula" comes from the mind of the alchemist.  This is the part that actually shapes what should happen, while the "hard formula" is used to gather the required energy/ handle the heavy lifting.  </p>

<p>On the subject of people who can transmute without circles, there are two different schools of thought.</p>

<p>The first follows the anime/manga rigidly, and interprets Izumi''s words literally.  They see it as the ''reward'' for losing part of yourself when you looked beyond the gate.  Looking beyond the gate exacts a toll from you, which is then used to "pay" for the privilege of seeing the base code of the universe.  Knowing this base code, alchemists are able to use the "soft" formula to a greater extent, and do not require the assistance of a "hard" formula in order to transmute.</p>

<p>The second possible explaination is more of an unintended side effect.  Remember how Barry the Chopper lost his body?  Well, his soul (in the armor) was able to sense his body''s presence (and vice-versa).  If one assumes the figure at the gate (which takes peoples'' body parts) is god (or at least, the source of alchemy), then him "wearing" an alchemists parts (pardon the term) is essentially giving that alchemist a very subtle, yet powerful connection on a mental level.  The alchemists are able to use their missing parts to bridge the gap separating them from this god-like being, and thus transmute seemingly at will.  </p>

<p>Alphonse, not having a physical body at all with which to form a bridge, is unable to skip the "hard formula" at first, but upon re-visiting the experience in his own mind, he forces himself to build this "bridge" and can transmute naturally from then on.</p>

<p>Goku leveled up to SSJ3 on the other dimension and never really planned to reveal it because he didn''t want to show it on front of Vegeta. At this point he would have made up his mind if it comes to fighting Vegeta on the tournament he would resort to Mystic saiyan mode to deal with him.</p>

<p>Turns out Vegeta ends up dead and Goku in desperation to buy time for Trunks decides to show case SSJ3 to Buu and I believe it''s the difference between the dimensions; I mean, the time it takes to generate the same power in this dimension could be entirely different I presume and also on the aspect that Goku didn''t spend time on that mode, because he could have been practicing extensively on the Mystic mode for the tournament and so it took quite a toll on his energy levels when he uses it first time.</p>

<p>When he uses it on the second time with Kid Buu. He seems to have a grasp on the energy levels and fights for a longer time until the point he uses a Kamehameha way in desperation to finish off Kid Buu and also holding out so Vegeta can fight him causes him to suffer towards the end as well. Also the fight happens on the Kai''s planet which becomes another different dimension compared to earth also I think that might have aided him a lot because thats where Gohan reaches ascension trained by Supreme Kai.</p>

<p>I believe it''s the changes in the environment primarily taking a toll on Goku''s body. As for SSJ4 I haven''t seen Dragonball GT (primarily for the lack of Bruce Faulconer''s theme :P) but as from the images I think the tail helps the body to handle the power levels differently because I somehow synonymize that to a controlled transformed Mode. </p>

<p>Quoting from <a href="http://animeotaku.animeblogger.net/2008/09/code-geass-r2-25-so-is-lelouch-dead-or-not/" rel="noreferrer">this blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most obvious reason would be CC calling to Lelouch in the closing scene of the episode. As we can assume CC to be still sane, she must be talking to someone, and that someone would most probably be the driver of the cart: Lelouch would have to be alive.</p>
<p>Second, however, and this is where the others have thought things through, Lelouch is alive because he got his dad''s code. He beckoned the World of C to lend him its powers, and he took Charles''s code before Charles passed on. The reason why Lelouch still has his Geass is because he didn''t take the Code from the same person who gave him his Geass: he took his Geass from CC, and he took his Code from Charles. Thus, he now possesses both immortality and a Geass. This is also a reason that the title is <em><strong>Code Geass: Lelouch</strong> of the Rebellion</em>.</p>
<p>To further corroborate this, however, remember that when Nunnally held Lelouch''s hand he transferred his memories to her. CC also did it when Lelouch touched her accidentally back then, so it could be assumed that people with Codes are indeliberate telepaths. This leaves us with both immortals traversing the world for the rest of eternity.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Additional evidences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Charles grabbed Lelouch with his right hand, which had the Geass sigil.</li>
<li>Lelouch needed the fully evolved Geass to transfer a code.</li>
<li>The code doesn''t appear to activate until someone dies. Hence, why C.C. was wounded when she first inherited her code. Same happened with Charles in the World of C.</li>
<li>When Lelouch touched Nunnally, Nunnally got a flash of his memories. This ONLY happens when a high potential Geass user touches someone with the fully evolved Geass.</li>
<li>The title of the series is "R2″, which is similar to how "C.C" is pronounced. So Lelouch would be "R.R." which is Engrish (I presume) for L.L., Lelouch Lamprouge.</li>
<li>When C.C. is talking on the wagon, she says "the power of Geass brings loneliness…that''s not quite right is it, Lelouch?" and nods her head in the direction of the wagon driver.</li>
</ol>
<p>[Furthermore,] Orange knew of Lelouch''s and Suzaku''s plan and helped them out by ordering his men not to fire on Zero, he even smiled when Zero (Suzaku) jumped on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Now would Orange, a man who devoted himself entirely to Lelouche and threw away everything without a second thought be OK with a plan where the sole person he wants to protect in life is actually killed? The answer to that is NO, not even if Lelouch ordered him to accept the plan: he would not go along with it and would protect him with his life. There is only one way that Orange would be OK with a plan like that and that''s if he knew about Lelouch''s immortality, which I assume he did as he worked with V.V. in the Geass research base. Orange was OK with this plan as he knew Lelouch would come to no harm and would be able to start a new peaceful life with the woman he loves in a world which he himself had made peaceful.</p>
<p>Even at the end, we see Orange on his orange plantation, completely content with the way things have panned out, he definitely could not be that happy had Lelouch actually died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Lelouch and CC lived happily ever after, literally.</p>

It follows it pretty closely with the anime, but there are some subtle differences. The series ends after the Tuatha de Danaan hijacking is resolved. </p>

<p><strong>Overload</strong> does not follow any of the anime at all and was published as a type of side story that is not related to the anime or the light novels. <strong>Surplus</strong> is basically the (1 volume) sequel to Overload. None of this is canon, it''s essentially an officially-published doujinshi.</p>

<p><strong>Comic Mission</strong> is more of a light-hearted side story (by the same artist as the original), like <em>Fumoffu</em>, that deviates from the main mecha story. Each chapters is more or less a self contained short story. Certain stories like "Cinderella Panic" are from the light novel''s side stories while other are original scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Sigma</strong> is a continuation of the anime, but illustrated by a different artist (Ueda Hiroshi). It begins around the same time as <em>The Second Raid</em> (Volume 4: <em>Ending Day By Day</em>). This manga parallels the light novels and picks up where TSR left off and deals with the events after it. This series is meant to be a continuation of the original manga. </p>

<p><strong>Another</strong> is another story in the <em>Full Metal Panic</em> universe, set 11 years after the events in the original FMP series with Sosuke and Kaname, with a new protagonist, new heroine. Lina (short for: Adelina Aleksandrovna Kerenskaya) is an AS pilot for the PMC, known as DOMS (Dana O''Shee Military Service), which seems to be have been created by Tessa and run by Mao.

<p>I think the most probable reason is the fact that when you''re watching broadcasts on TV, as soon as the ending theme song pops up you change to another channel. Almost nobody watches the ending credits/openings and this is true also for other things. Think about when you go to the movies: when the credits starts rolling, is there someone that will stay sit there? Maybe, but that''s quite rare. Same for movies on TV, you usually change it because... you really don''t care, unless you need to look up some actor/character in those rare occasions.</p>

<p>For this reason, and I''m quite convinced this is the case, they cut the ending theme song, made the opening longer and put the credits there instead. More people are likely to watch it, not just those that like the song, but also once you get to the channel, you''re less likely to change it <em>just because</em> it hasn''t started yet.</p>

<p>Along with the recap, this makes the "opening part" much longer, even cutting from the usual ~24 minutes of actual episode time.</p>

<p>My opinion is that the spirits are <em>forced</em> to appear once the wizard acquires the key. The key, as we know, is usually required to open the gate though which the spirit comes from the spirit world. When the gates are opened in the first time, the wizard and the spirit make an agreement (e.g. on which days should the spirit be summoned). </p>

<p>Now, if you look at how do the spirits react when Lucy calls them, you may notice some interesting things. For example, when she summons Aquarius, Aquarius is often disappointed with Lucy, and shortly returns to the spirit word, sometimes refusing to do what Lucy asks for. </p>

<p>One might ask: <em>why in that case would the spirit even appear</em>? If Aquarius is not in the mood, she could as well not appear at all, rather than be summoned and almost instantly go back (after a few insults towards Lucy, that is). That leads us to an assumption that the spirits can not actually refuse to be summoned, and possessing the key almost equals possessing the spirit''s contract (they just have no other options).</p>

<p>Some spirits, however, find benefits in working with the wizards, for example, Taurus enjoys being summoned because that way he can observe Lucy''s body, which he admires. </p>

<p>In general, most of the spirits become very loyal to Lucy once she acquires their keys, so that is another argument for the assumption that possessing the key forces the spirit to make the contract and work for the wizard.</p>

The Vongola send their most powerful hitman—who turns out to be a gun-toting infant named Reborn—to tutor Tsuna on how to become a respectable mafia boss.</p>

  <p>...each State Alchemist is given a silver pocketwatch to
  hold as identification. This watch is engraved with the symbol of the
  State Alchemist program - the Amestrian Dragon circumscribed in a
  hexagram (though both anime series alter the hexagram to a nondescript
  polygram, presumably so as not to invoke Judaism). Although <strong>the manga
  does not describe the pocketwatch as anything more than official proof
  that the carrier is a State Alchemist</strong>, <strong>the 2003 anime suggests that
  each pocketwatch is an alchemical amplifier</strong>. The 2003 anime also
  depicts the watch''s silver chain as extendable, as in the instance
  when the Strong Arm Alchemist, Major Alex Louis Armstrong uses it to
  tie up a target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, according to the 2003 anime, the watch amplifies the alchemist''s powers. However, both manga and <em>FMA:Brotherhood</em> shows that the watch is simply a form of identification, much like a police badge. </p>

<p>Also note that in the anime the watch is the indicator which people use to recognize Edward as a State Alchemist. I believe that unless the State Alchemist himself tells you who he is, the presence of the watch is the only other way to know it (they also get a certificate, but I doubt they carry it around).</p>

<p>It also adds, regarding his motivations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Way of Jashin is absolute for Hidan, the only thing worth believing in. He considers his supreme purpose to be to spread the Way of Jashin to nonbelievers throughout the world. It means to create a world that acknowledges mass killing. And Hidan feels that this is possible by being a part of the Akatsuki.</p>

I know the thrill of finding that diamond in the rough. I’ve seen far too many incredibly vapid products become success stories. Want to know what the difference is between these two things? </p>

<p>Making a great product requires skill. Selling that great product requires a different skill. </p>

<p>If people have trouble figuring out what you have? If people have trouble what it can do for them? They’ll buy someone else’s product. If they buy it, but have trouble figuring out how to use it? They’ll switch to someone else’s product.</p>

<p>My job is to make it clear what you do and what you offer. Ever heard of the 10x “rockstar” programmer? The one that produces 10x the output of everyone else? User experience (UX) designers produce 2x-100x return on investment (ROI). Imagine what you could do with 100x of what you have now… </p>

<ul>
<li>I’m a UX Designer. </li>
<li>I know how to code. </li>
<li>I know how to communicate. </li>
<li>I know how to provide killer visuals.  </li>
<li>I know how to present ideas. </li>
<li>I know how to sell.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, I know how to give you want you want.</p>

<p>I’m always looking for a new challenge. I’d love to find a company looking to take their UX to the next level. Is your company willing to pay more than lip service to user experience? Are you ready to solve your problems? Feel free to contact me directly at rach@lid.cc.</p>

<p>I work for <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EnterpriseDB</a>, assisting a bunch of really skilled people share their PostgreSQL expertise and experience with the world. </p>

<p>Before that, I worked here - at Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange. Here, my duties <em>also</em> involved helping a bunch of really skilled people share their knowledge. So you might encounter some posts from me which provide guidance and advice for the folks using this network of Q&amp;A sites.</p>

<p>I tend to write as though I know what I''m writing about... And sometimes I do... But, you should always use your own judgement: question everything, read the links to supporting materials, and draw your own conclusions. I''m usually happy to discuss anything I''ve written, so don''t hesitate to raise concerns or point out when something is unclear!</p>

<p>One really big peeve I''ve realized, I dislike it when someone says something is wrong based off of the usage being <em>uncommon</em>. Think outside the box, and a new world of <em>usage</em> may surprise you! (<em>I still haven''t the faintest clue if I''m being sarcastic or not with that last bit</em>...? Ah, yes, slightly sarcastic.) I also dislike when people suggest diminishing a nice set of vocabulary just because the words are not used often in today''s time. It sickens me when I see this. </p>

<ul>
<li>I love to read</li>
<li>I love to write</li>
<li>I love music</li>
<li>I love making [pointless] hobby sites</li>
<li>And nothing gets between me and raspberries ;) </li>
</ul>

<p>I''ve been stuck on writing three different books since I was 17. Keeping that in mind... I know, realistically, I''m probably never going to be an amazing author and will have to die with the dream of being a best-seller still in my head. Thankfully, I have this great interest in web ''design''. I hate using that word, because most people who say ''Oh yeah, I''m totally into web design'', are the same people using Dreamweaver or some other WYSIWYG program instead of opening up a trusty notepad-like blank document and getting down and dirty with coding.
<br /> <em>(Loved-ones say I''m spectacular with assumptions...)</em></p>

<p>Along with making pointless hobby sites, <a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/~br0k3n" rel="nofollow">writing <em>amateur</em> poetry</a> (out of a collection, I have only maybe about 5 that I am particularly proud of), and being sick with writers'' block, I''m a huge sucker for reading and writing fanfiction. (<em>Go figure, no writers'' block there--for the most part</em>.)</p>

<p>I tend to make really bad/stupid/careless jokes. (Bad having a multitude of meanings, hence dash word dash... XD)</p>

<p>There is more about me that I''d like to share, but I think I''ve blabbered long enough. You all have a great one!</p>

<p>I enjoy anime and watch tons of it, and currently I am reading much manga. I like to edit stuff and correct English, and I probably wash my hands too often but I don''t have OCD (haha?). </p>

<p>In the future, I would like to become a Linguist (also known as a translator or interpretor). I would like to be able to translate between Japanese&lt;->English, Korean&lt;->English and Korean&lt;->Japanese. However, I think I''ll try to learn more languages :)</p>

<p>Things I like doing are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Programming with Python</li>
<li>Japanese stuff. Korean stuff. Speaking it, living it, smelling it. (?)</li>
<li>Hacking when I can</li>
<li>Modding the Sims 3 and other programs</li>
<li>Messing with Ubuntu (and often for the worst)</li>
<li>Play Skyrim, Tekkit, Minecraft, Sims 3, Final Fantasy and other games</li>
<li>Geeking out</li>
<li>Manga (Koizora = my favourite)</li>
<li>Anime (Clannad, <strong><em>NANA</em></strong> and Reborn! being my absolute favourites) and</li>
<li>K-Pop. Because it''s awesome.</li>
</ul>

<p>I work my way around, and am quite capable... but I still won''t declare myself an expert yet :P</p>

<p>I am one of the few females around here, though I am admittedly on the verge of being a boy. I am fairly feminine in real life, but I play Skyrim, Final Fantasy and hack and mod. What does that make me?!</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for the long bio, thanks for visiting and bye!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During his keynote speech at the 2007 PAX (Penny Arcade Expo), Wheaton
  made a note about sportsmanship when playing games online. It has
  since become known as Wheaton''s rule or law, which states "<strong>Don''t be
  a dick!</strong>"<a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2007/08/pax-ftw.html" rel="nofollow">¹</a> This was intended to apply to life in general, not
  just online gaming.<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wilw/status/5967205052" rel="nofollow">²</a></p>
  
  <p>A revision of Wheaton''s law is an expansion by comics artist and
  writer Bill Willingham, which states: "Don''t be a dick, but it''s okay
  to play one on TV."<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BillWillingham/status/5966635766" rel="nofollow">³</a></p>

This also explains why references to Haruhi and Full Metal Panic weren''t censored (as far as I remember). Interestingly these instances of censorship probably could have been removed in the English release since it was licensed by Bandai, but I don''t know if they actually were, so this question might only apply to the Japanese version.

However, there are still a few cases of references which weren''t censored despite no obvious connection between the Lucky Star team and the source.

To Heart is associated with VN studio Leaf as well as animation studios Oriental Light and Magic and AIC, neither of which have anything to do with Lucky Star (KyoAni and Kadokawa).

[Here''s a GREAT example of multiple anime styles used in a single show --][1] we go from "high quality" level animation for the transformations, to the more "western", flash-friendly style the show is normally in, to a rather garish live-action explosion at the end. These all require different approaches.

If you pay attention, you can also spot where the characters aren''t moving much in certain points in the video (like where Panty & Stocking are standing still under the "disco" lighting), so they can get away with only drawing the frame once even though the scene goes for much longer. 

When "tweening" between keyframes (to produce moving animation like your soccer ball example), yes, those have to be hand-drawn -- or at least hand-checked, even if a computer is used to extrapolate between keyframes! Using certain animation software like [Flash][2], [Toon Boom][3], or 3D modeling software like [Blender][4] may take out some of the work, but none of that software can compensate for a bad animator, or replace an artist at the helm. 

There''s plenty of shortcuts animators use, but the computer never draws the cartoon for them -- they still have to do that part themselves!

Most of these different aspects I really don''t understand. 

As for the number of episodes: the *''reboot''* actually catches up to the first version rather fast (in about the first 4th) and then has *''new material''* (comparing to the first one) until the end of it. Brotherhood also has more episodes (64, compared to 51) .

The most recent example that I can think of is when Kawaragi Shiho, the seiyuu of Nishizono Mio from Little Busters!, got pregnant. In fact, this is very recent, as she just [gave birth][1] last Friday (December 7th). Of course Mio isn''t the main character, but she''s not a minor character either.

In this case, they just replaced her (with Tatsumi Yuiko). That''s about the only real option they have most of the time. Unless the problem is only for a very short duration, the entire show is not going to be delayed for one seiyuu. If it happens well in advance and the character is pretty important, they can probably work around it. Gotou Yuuko (seiyuu for Hiro from Hidamari Sketch), who was on hiatus for a while this year for health reasons but is back now in Hidamari Sketch x Honeycomb, is a good example of this. However, this is a pretty atypical situation, and the other shows she was in mostly got replacements.

In the end, unless the character is crucially important, it''s very likely that they''ll get a replacement, since it''s pretty much the only realistic option. If something like this happens for a popular character in the off-season, it can also affect the possibility of sequels (e.g. most shows with Aya Hirano leads probably aren''t in the sequel market). It usually doesn''t hurt the seiyuu''s career too much if it occurs for good reasons e.g. health, but some impact is inevitable.

Manga production happens at a much smaller scale compared to [anime production](http://washiblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/anime-production-detailed-guide-to-how-anime-is-made-and-the-talent-behind-it/).

For anime production, on top of publisher front costs, you have so get your staff, sponsors, script, character/set designers, broadcasting rights, and advertising ready before the production even starts. 

Typically only half the budget allocated to an anime is used by the studio in charge. 

Manga production can vary greatly. Some authors are interested in creative input from their assistants, while others only ask them to assist. Some artists like do to as much of the work themselves as possible, others have their assistants fill in most of the page while the artist only draws the "name" (a kind of storyboard for manga) and main characters.

Anime are usually created and broadcast at a loss while profits are made from DVD/Blu-ray and merchandising sales. Most mangas are produced at a loss, their viability access by their rank in their parent magazine''s reader survey polls and takubon (volume) sales. 

Generally, it takes around [8,000,000 to 10,000,000 yen](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/makaronisan/20060719/1153219520) to make a "30 minute" episode anime, while it takes only about 2,000,000 yen to produce a weekly serialization, because typically takes 2 months for a tankoubon can be compiled, at a 100-page monthly production rate. 

On top of that you have to factor in rent for the studio, and payroll (pay + pensions) for that staff which typically is composed of 1 chief-assistant + 2 or 3 assistants + 1 background artist, typically a group of 4 to 5 people. Different authors/artist get different rates depending on the publisher and the experience/fame of the author/artist. 

Most animators are [contract employees to a production studio](http://motoz5.cocolog-nifty.com/animator/2006/12/post_41df.html). Therefore they get benefits, pensions, or vacations. Because many productions employ so many animators for their tween animations it can be hard to keeps track of who''s who and doing what.

A well managed small anime production can sometimes be more efficient than a large high budget manga serialization, but the opposite can be true as well. It usually comes down to who is an change and how the work trickles down.','CC BY-SA 3.0'),

If we have to show more detailed difference I''d say:


**Visual characteristics**  
Anime: Distinct facial expressions. Wide variation in physical characteristics. 
Physical features of characters are, on the whole, closer to reality than cartoons.  
Cartoon: Characters usually have features that are not relative to the rest of the body and therefore further from reality than anime.


**Topics/Themes**  
Anime: concentrates mostly on life issues or things tied closer to human emotion.  
Cartoons: are generally made to make people laugh and so is more comical.

**Definition and Term:**  
Anime: English dictionaries define the word as ‘Japanese style of motion picture animation’. 
Cartoon: was used as a model or study for a painting but is now associated with caricatures for humor and satire.

Some Anime get censored when dubbed in foreign countries and they are rendered as quite childish (and this is sometimes really annoying), while the original holds some adult references, scenes containing violence and so on. While this is not true for all Anime, as some are really aimed to children, some of them need a mature audience.

Also, the **characters** are treated quite differently. There is more growth in Anime characters as it develops for a whole series. For example, *Zabuza* in Naruto ends up being quite a likeable character because you go beyond him simply being an antagonist.

Anime treat **themes** like *life, death, religion and ethics*. Cartoons really treat such matters quite differently. 

Finally, even if quite banal, there is also the fact that by Anime we exclusively refer to Japanese cartoons.','CC BY-SA 3.0'),

Domestic cartoons and anime can vary in drawing styles, based on the staff, budget, and character/set designs. Anime series are typically more detailed than your average domestic show as there is more of a abundance of technically skilled artists than there are domestically.

Both can reach different age regardless of their initial target audience (E.g., Avatar: The Last Airbender, My Little Pony and Adventure Time for an example). Typically domestic cartoons are more light hearted when compared to Japanese anime. Both can deal with more mature themes, in both a serious (like Cyber 6) and humorous light (As with Futurama, South Park, Simpsons, and Family Guy). There are domestic cartoons for adults just like there are 18+ anime in Japan.

If you ask the average person in your country and one in Japan both will consider them to be childish. The difference between anime and cartoons is very subjective. It typically comes down to what you like and how you like it.

It''s sequel, Diebuster, was also originally released as a six episode OVA 18 years later. Typically sequels are released around the time of the original so it''s fresh in the minds of people. Without giving too much away the storys are some one connected. Diebuster happens ~12,000 years after Gunbuster.

To take care of the time gap issue with Gunbuster, both series have been cut into two movies and presented as a double-feature.

The reference to each other are subtle.

For an example if you didn''t watch Gunbuster You would know that: 

 - Nono appears in Gunbuster under a different name

 - The Diebuster ending only makes sense if you saw the ending of Gunbuster (takes place 12,000 years earlier)

 - You wouldn''t understand the Solar System Defence System and why it was attacking

 - You wouldn''t understand why the drive was removed from Dix-Neuf','CC BY-SA 3.0'),

Walt Disney didn''t think [Fantasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_(film)) was for children either. Having watched the film several times, I''m inclined to agree. The point is that although they have tended in that direction (with a few notable exceptions) in the western world, there is no particular reason to limit cartoon themes to kids.

> **Sometimes, they even display sarcastic attitudes, so that giving a serious long explanation wouldn''t be possible.** What are the effective ways to explain that anime is different from cartoons in these kind of situations? Are there any clever sentences that will make an impact on people who don''t know about anime?

I realize you only included this for context... but if someone is being sarcastic, it''s not as if any real answer is applicable. This section of the question is also probably offtopic.

From then, Ichigo possesses a sealed zanpakutoh that he uses (alongside Rukia in a *gigai*) to fight Hollows around Karakura. 

Later:

This implies that Ichigo had *borrowed* his powers from Rukia for the run of what is usually called The Karakura Arc. This is further supported when....

> ! Ichigo gains his own zanpakutoh, Zangetsu, and his sword is unsealed rather than in its more beign state.

Because Ichigo is borrowing Rukia''s spirit powers, and because Zangetsu''s form appears to be more volatile and less prone to remaining sealed, **is the first zanpakutoh that Ichigo carries with him Sode no Shiraiyuki**?

Can this amount of required materials be calculated by the alchemist? If so, how? Are there some sort of lookup-tables?

Or does one need to guess and provides something of more value to be on the safe side? If so, can one become a more skilled alchemist by experience of successful guesses?

Also, different alchemists might have different specialized skills. How does that work? For the guessing part, I can imagine that one have a preference for certain kinds of alchemy and thus gain experience with a specialized skill.','CC BY-SA 3.0');
